**Identifying N6,2’-O-Dimethyladenosine Sites based on Stacking Ensemble Deep Learning**

A post-transcriptional alteration, N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) has recently been experimentally shown to be associated with several human disorders, including RNA methylation, obesity genes, and stomach cancer. As a result, the post-transcriptionally changed N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) site will play a crucial part in the regulation of RNA if it can be correctly identified. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based m6Am prediction model, EMDL_m6Am, which employs one hot encoding to deduce the feature map of the RNA sequence and recognizes m6Am sites by integrating different CNN models via stacking. Three deep learning models were integrated with stacking to extract critical features from the encoded Data in this study. These models include DenseNet, Inflated Convolutional Network (DCNN), Deep Multiscale Residual Network (MSRN). In our works, training data prediction sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (ACC), Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC), and area under the curve (AUC) reached to be 86.62%, 88.94%, 87.78%, 0.7590, and 0.8778, and the independent test also achieved high scores of 82.25%, 79.72%, 80.98%, 0.6199, and 0.8211. The experimental results demonstrated that EMDL_m6Am greatly improved the predictive performance of the m6Am sites and could provide a valuable reference for the next part of the study.
